# Build subcomponents in parallel and run CMake tests in parallel.
# Note this does not control whether the build tool in use is building
# in parallel.  Rather, this controls whether other build tools used
# by subsidiary builds to also build in parellel (e.g. boost b2,
# msbuild).  Its purpose is to allow such additional parallelism to be
# disabled on resource-constrained systems.
